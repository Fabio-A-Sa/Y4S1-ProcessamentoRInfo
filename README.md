The internet's exponential growth demands appropriate systems for harnessing and connecting this massive information resource. This project addresses this need by focusing on the hotel industry, where reviews play a crucial role in shaping consumer choices. This article aims to provide a clear and well-documented explanation of the work needed in developing a robust search engine for hotel reviews. To accomplish this, data is collected from multiple sources, cleaned and prepared, and in-depth data analysis is undertaken.
